### Abstract

Sentiment analysis is a common task in natural language processing that aims to detect the polarity of a text document.
In the simplest situation, we discriminate only between positive and negative sentiment, turning the task into a standard binary classification problem.
Sentiment classification can be useful in business intelligence as it quickly summarizes consumer sentiments as feedback for a particular product.
Movie reviews are of great essence as they can help viewers get an overview of the movie and also provide feedback to the producers and directors about their works based on what the public thinks about it.
However, manually analyzing sentiments in reviews becomes tedious due to the large amount of corpuses present across several movie review pages.
In this project, we investigate various deep learning algorithms for classifying sentiments and try implementing various ensemble models over three sequential models on the IMDb movie review dataset.
The results of this research show that the ensemble models achieve higher accuracy than their base learners, the highest being 90.4% on the IMDb dataset, which is on par with state-of-the-art research and our proposed model. 
These results demonstrate that ensemble learning methods can be used as a viable method for sentiment classification. Our results are easily reproducible, as we publish the code/notebooks of our experiment.
